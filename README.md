## Description
Set dynamic CSS variables for whitelabeling your application.

## Typical usage scenario
When dynamic theming is desired. If styling is to be different for other user(roles) or database settings. 

## Features and limitations

### Features
Using CSS variables in your application? Dynamically overwrite these variables with for example profile specific colors.

Though the value could be anything, this widget was designed as a tool to work with whitelabeling colors. Get creative!

### Limitations
At this point, the variables don't react to a dark-mode theme variant (though you could add a separate dark-mode variable).

## Dependencies
none

## Installation
Install the widget and define one or more variables.

## Configuration
In the studio Pro, just define a variable name and variable value.
This can be something like `brand-primary` with a color value `#BADA55`.
The value can be inserted as an expression.

## Bugs
none known at this moment.
